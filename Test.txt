# Music Sharing Social Media App
For my final year university project i'm developing a social media application in Swift for people to share their music tastes.

# Summary 
The app is based of the social media app BeReal where user get a notification daily to tell them to send a picture of what they are doing. In my app users will receive a notification telling the to post the song the are listening to or have most recently listend to. The idea is that this will make it easier for users to share their musics tastes with their friends. Hopefully this will help people find common tastes and also discover new music.
